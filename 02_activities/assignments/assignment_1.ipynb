    "Advantages of Using Dask for Rolling Operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "Lazy Evaluation: Dask operations are lazily evaluated, meaning computations are deferred until necessary (e.g., when results are needed for further processing or output). This allows Dask to handle datasets that are larger than memory by operating on chunks of data.\n",
    "\n",

Performing calculations in Dask avoids unnecessary data transfer and retains the advantages of distributed computing and lazy evaluation.
